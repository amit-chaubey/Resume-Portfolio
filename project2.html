            <h1>Digi-Recognizer: Mastering the Art of Digit Recognition</h1>

            <ul>
                <li><a href="#">Live Demo</a></li>

            </ul>
			<p>The Digi-Recognizer was engineered with a singular purpose: to accurately identify hand-written digits, transforming scribbles into understandable data with ease. Whether it's a hastily jotted down phone number or ancient numerical runes, this system stands ready to decode them all.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>The Challenge:
					Data cleaning was akin to navigating through a scrapyard, requiring meticulous preprocessing to ensure that every digit, regardless of its handwriting style, was recognizable to our AI.</li>
                <li>Deployment:
					The Digi-Recognizer now stands as a beacon of digital literacy, ready to be deployed in educational tools, automated form processing, and wherever digits need deciphering.</li>
                <li>Future Upgrades:
					Looking ahead, we envision integrating more advanced algorithms and expanding our model's capabilities to recognize not just digits, but handwritten letters and symbols from various languages, bridging worlds and cultures.</li>
